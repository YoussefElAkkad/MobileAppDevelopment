//A query typically refers to a
//request for information or data
//from a database or search engine.
// In computing, it's often used to
// retrieve specific information
// that matches certain criteria.
// For example, when you search
// for something on a search engine
// like Google, you're essentially
// submitting a query to the search
// engine's database,asking it to
//  return relevant results based on
// the keywords or terms you entered.
// Similarly, in database management systems,
//  queries are used to retrieve, insert,
// update, or delete data from a database.
